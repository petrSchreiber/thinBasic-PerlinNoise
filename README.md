## thinBasic-PerlinNoise
Improved Perlin Noise function for the thinBasic language

  **1. Include File:**  PerlinNoise.tbasici
  
  **2. Console Test Program:** testNoise.tbasi

```
There are two functions for the programmer:
1. PerlinNoiseSeed ( seedValue )
seedValue is an integer number, it will affect the noise returned from:

2. PerlinNoise( x, y, z ) 
x, y, z are double values

You generally use PerlinNoiseSeed ( seedValue ) once in the beginning to give you the same noise results
each time your program runs.
```
